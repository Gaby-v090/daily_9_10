#Assignment: Using the air quality from R datasets

##Question 1:
 airquality

##Question 2:
library(dplyr)
library(visdat)
vis_dat(airquality)
airquality_cleaned <- na.omit(airquality)  

##Question 3: Solar radiation has a natural relationship with ozone levels 
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality_cleaned)
 
##Question 4: The model is valid shows the proportion between ozone and solar radiation
summary(model)

##Question 5: There is approx. 11.3% of the variation in ozone levels can be explained by solar radiation

##Question 6: 
library(broom)
a <- augment(model, newdata = airquality_cleaned)
head(a)

##Question 7:
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(a, aes(x = Ozone, y = .fitted))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Actual vs Predicted Ozone Levels",
    x = "Actual Ozone",
    y = "Predicted Ozone",
    subtitle = paste("Correlation:", round(cor(airquality_cleaned$Ozone, a$.fitted),2))
  )+  
  theme_dark()
```
